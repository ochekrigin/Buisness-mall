These ten campaigns support, protect and nurture the environment all in their own way — from keeping beaches and marine life clean to monitoring polar ice caps. Learn about (and get involved with!) the campaigns doing their part to take care of the planet.</p>\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"http://www.charitywater.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Charity: Water</a></p>\n\n<p><div class='wordpress-caption'><img alt=\"Charity Water\" src=\"http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Charity%20Water_OS_604.jpg?itok=-LoqzROp\" width=\"604\" height=\"400\" /> Photo by Esther Havens</div>\n<br />Though charity: water sets out to help <em>people</em> rather than the environment itself, they <em>are </em>giving new life to one of the planet’s natural resources. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_part2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Unsafe water</a> (and lack of basic sanitation) kills more people every year than all forms of violence combined, including war. This charity aims to significantly reduce disease in the developing world by making one of life’s most basic needs — clean water — more accessible. The organisation chooses locations in need around the world to build water and sanitation services, considerably reducing the amount of time and effort spent collecting water (that wasn't even safe in the first place). The best part about this charity? 100 percent of public donations go to funding projects. (In other words, your donation goes right to where it’s needed — not to help cover charity: water’s operating costs.)</p>\n\n<p>Want to help fund a water project?

Not only is tap water more <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2013/07/12/cost_of_bottled_water_vs_tap_water_the_difference_will_shock_you.html\" target=\"_blank\">cost-efficient</a>, but one person going disposable-free for a month saves an average of 18 bottles from entering landfills. Purchasing your own reusable bottle and tossing it in a work or gym bag takes no time and — best of all — it’s free to fill up. Pledging to ditch disposable doesn’t have to stop after 30 days. Make it a habit and <a href=\"http://greatist.com/health/how-much-water-should-i-drink-stay-hydrated\" target=\"_blank\">stay hydrated</a> the smart way.</p>\n\n<p>Ready to ditch disposable? Pledge <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CamelBak?sk=app_285510531582566&amp;app_data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>3. <a href=\"http://www.farmland.org/actioncenter/no-farms-no-food/local-food.asp\" target=\"_blank\">No Farms No Food</a></p>\n\n<p><div class='wordpress-caption'><img alt=\"No Farms No Food\" src=\"http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/No%20Farm%20No%20Food_OS_604.jpg?itok=rFVAHvrG\" width=\"604\" height=\"400\" /> Photo: Farmland.org</div>\n<br />Whether we like it or not, our food systems have drastically changed — for better <em>and</em> for worse. The message of No Farms No Food is simple: Supporting local food is crucial. This campaign uses donations to protect local farmland, educate communities about the importance of farms, and push legislation to support local food. Eating locally grown, seasonal produce can actually be a much <a href=\"http://www.clevelandclinicwellness.com/food/SeasonalEating/Pages/introduction.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">better choice</a> for the environment and your health too. Most of the time, choosing produce grown at local farms — general considered to be within a 160 km radius — can be the greener (and more nutritious) choice since fruits and veggies don’t need to be shipped across the country.</p>\n\n<p>4. <a href=\"http://www.thinkeatsave.org/index.php/about\" target=\"_blank\">Think.Eat.Save</a></p>\n\n<p><div class='wordpress-caption'><img alt=\"Think.Eat.Save\" src=\"http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/ThinkEatSave_OS_604.jpg?itok=yxLXA7Pm\" width=\"604\" height=\"400\" /> Photo: Think.Eat.Save</div>\n<br />Ever tossed a bunch of bananas because they ripened too fast or dumped a package of expired chicken in the trash? Think.Eat.Save is on a mission to help people become more aware of food waste. Using initiatives already set in place, including the <a href=\"http://www.save-food.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Save Food</a> initiative and <a href=\"http://www.feeding5k.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Feeding the 5000</a>, plus tonnes of tips to cut down on food waste, this campaign is about changing people’s habits to spark lifelong change. At the end of the day, wasted food means <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=2726&amp;ArticleID=9611\" target=\"_blank\">wasted water</a>, energy, and land, plus loads of greenhouse gas emissions from both the production and disposal of food.</p>\n\n<p>Ready to think, eat, and save?

IceBridge, the largest airborne survey of Earth’s polar ice, will soon provide us the most accurate measure of change over time. The data collected during the mission (which will be completed in 2016) <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/40799-operation-icebridge-antarctica-mission.html\" target=\"_blank\">helps scientists</a> keep track of annual changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers and ice sheets. Rather then prevent further environmental damage like some of the other campaigns on this list, IceBridge is out to provide concrete data about what to expect from global climate change for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>6. <a href=\"http://www.iwanttoberecycled.org/\" target=\"_blank\">I Want to Be</a></p>\n\n<p><div class='wordpress-caption'><img alt=\"I Want to Be\" src=\"http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/I%20Want%20to%20Be_OS_604.png?itok=NltzI6Mz\" width=\"604\" height=\"400\" /> Photo: I Want to Be</div>\n<br />Rather than sound like a “rinse, reuse, recycle” broken record, I Want to Be urges people to give their trash new life. In partnership with <a href=\"http://www.kab.org/site/PageServer?pagename=index\" target=\"_blank\">Keep America Beautiful</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.adcouncil.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ad Council</a>, this campaign turns things like water bottles and aluminium cans into new, inventive and useful objects like park benches, bikes and siding for sports stadiums.

Trees not only bring nature to metropolitan areas, they help clean the air by absorbing pollutants, provide oxygen, save water and grow food (amongst plenty of other <a href=\"http://www.treepeople.org/top-22-benefits-trees\" target=\"_blank\">benefits</a>).</p>\n\n<p>8. <a href=\"http://www.sas.org.uk/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Surfers Against Sewage</a></p>\n\n<p><div class='wordpress-caption'><img alt=\"Surfers Against Sewage\" src=\"http://greatist.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main/public/Surfers%20Against%20Sewage_OS_604.jpg?itok=6n2Vt2rZ\" width=\"604\" height=\"400\" /> Photo: Surfers Against Sewage</div>\n<br />From cleaning up marine litter and sewage pollution, to increasing awareness about toxic chemicals and climate change, UK-based Surfers Against Sewage aims to improve the quality of the world’s oceans and beaches. While educating the public about conserving and protecting the marine environment, SAS works to change government policy and industry practices for the better, too. This <a href=\"http://www.sas.org.uk/awards/\" target=\"_blank\">award-winning</a> charity — with separate <a href=\"http://www.sas.org.uk/campaign/no-butts-on-the-beach/\" target=\"_blank\">campaigns</a> to combat marine litter, improve water quality and educate about climate change (for starters) — is taking care of beaches one <a href=\"http://www.sas.org.uk/campaign/no-butts-on-the-beach/\" target=\"_blank\">cigarette butt</a> at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Ready to clean up dirty beaches?

Putting a priority on sustainability by focusing on local food, Slow Food is a global organisation (spanning more than 160 countries) that teaches people how to make smart choices in food selection, celebrates food traditions and taking time to enjoy eating and tackles tough topics like genetically modified organisms and animal welfare. This campaign does a whole lot to protect local food through education events at schools and hospitals and with fairs and tours that showcase sustainable agriculture and artisan foods.</p>\n\n<p>Want to get involved?
